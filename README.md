# MANNER (Multi-view Attention Network for Noise ERasement)
This is a Pytorch implementation of MANNER: Multi-view Attention Network for Noise ERasement. MANNER is a deep learning model for speech enhancement in time-domain. MANNER consists of encoder-decoder based on U-net. Each encoder and decoder contains Up/Down conv, Residual Conformer block, and Multi-view Attention block. MANNER representing full information of the signal efficiently addresses channel and long sequential features. Experimental results on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset suggest that MANNER achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition, among time-domain models, MANNER shows the efficient results in terms of inference speed and memory usage.
